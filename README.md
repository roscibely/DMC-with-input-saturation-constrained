# Dynamic matrix control 
# with input saturation constrained ⚙️


 - The dynamic matrix control (DMC) with input saturation constrained is implemented with an anti-windup (AW) technique proposed by [Turner et. al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7085001)
 - The DMC-AW control is applied in the ball-beam system from [paper](https://doi.org/10.48011/asba.v2i1.1000). 
 - The DMC formulation is based on the description presented in Wu Hong Kwong's [book](https://www.edufscar.com.br/introducao-ao-controle-preditivo-com-matlab).
