# Dynamic matrix control 
# with input saturation constrained ⚙️


 - The dynamic matrix control (DMC) with input saturation constrained is implemented with an anti-windup (AW) technique proposed by [Turner et. al.](10.23919/ECC.2003.7085001)
 - The DMC-AW control is applied in the ball-beam system.
